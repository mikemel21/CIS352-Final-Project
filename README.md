# Overview
Build a streamlist data mining web application from scratch

# Tasks
1. (10) Download a dataset (google, kaggle, whatever. Be resourceful. Make sure itâ€™s a binary classification dataset. Examples are fraud detection, malware detection, cancer detection, etc.) 
2. (10) Build a Streamlit web application that loads the data and allows you to inspect the data 
3. (30) In the web app, build interactive functionalities that allow you to perform two types of normalization, such as z-score and min-max. 
4. (40) In the web app, build interactive functionalities to allow for classification using random forest, adaboost, SVM and decision tree. Make sure to add interactivity for the hyperparameters for the respective machine learning algorithms
5. (10) Submit the following:
    - A zip file containing every source code materials
    - A text file that contains a google drive PUBLIC link to a recorded demo of your web application. Double check if the link is public and can be accessed. If not, there will be penalties.
